# emoryhacks25

### Inspiration

Inspired by the mini dry-erase whiteboard, our group envisioned a website where individual users can join a room, draw anything on their own private whiteboard, and have the room host see every board updated live, allowing for people to express their own ideas in a collective room setting.

### What it does

Gallery Board updates live and in real-time, has auto generated anonymous names, and a clean and minimal UI. The whiteboard has a color-picker, eraser, and clear all feature.

### How we built it

We developed Gallery Board using Next.js (frontend and server integration) and socket.io (real-time bidirectional communication).

### Challenges we ran into

Deployment and using online API frameworks for persistent communications.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a working product during the Hackathon.

### What we learned

Websockets make deployment challenging, but are useful for live updating.

### What's next for Gallery Board

Online deployment as well as UI improvements and export options for each whiteboard.
